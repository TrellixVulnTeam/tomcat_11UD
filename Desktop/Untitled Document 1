		2. Become a System Architect

If you prefer to design and plan systems and solutions instead of run and troubleshoot them, the system architect position might be for you.

A system architect or solutions architect offers analysis of technical direction and determines the best technologies to create a system infrastructure.

Becoming a system architect is a natural next step for system administrators. System architects are responsible for:

    Planning the architecture of an organization’s IT systems based on company needs, cost and growth plans
    Determining the best way to integrate new technologies with existing applications, systems and platforms
    Researching, identifying, selecting and testing the technologies required to deliver IT solutions
    Implementing and documenting technology integration and migration strategies

As a system architect, you’ll experience much crossover with system administration. The main difference is that you’ll be responsible for planning and building the architecture rather than performing maintenance. 

Earning a certification can help you streamline the career transition to system architect. Here are a few certifications to start with:
AWS Certified Solutions Architect (CSA)

If your organization uses Amazon Web Services, the CSA certification can prepare you to architect and deploy secure and robust applications using AWS technologies. You’ll learn how to build AWS solutions and provide implementation guidance to an organization throughout the project’s life cycle.

    Security auditor
    Security engineer
    Security analyst
    Penetration tester/ethical hacker
